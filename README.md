# Secret-Santa
A simple algorithm that I created for Christmas 2021. I created a survey on Google Forms, where you needed the name of the participant and some of his dream gifts. Then I exported a csv file from Forms and created a simple "Secret Santa" algorithm. I will be working on improving the sending of e-mails to participants to whom they should give a Christmas gift.
